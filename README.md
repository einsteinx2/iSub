## April 2021 Update: iSub is once again under development! It has been modernized and ported to Swift 5 in the main iSub repo here: https://github.com/einsteinx2/iSubMusicStreamer. This repo is a much older, unfinished Swift port and modernization effort that was never completed. I've left this repo here for preservation sake, but all current and future development is happening in the above linked repo.

## The currently released App Store version can be found here: https://github.com/einsteinx2/iSubMusicStreamer. If you would like to submit a bug fix or add a feature to the release version, fork that repo and submit a PR. I'm happy to review and merge any reasonable PRs and get them out in the next update.

### How to build
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the **iSub Beta** target.
3. That's it! All frameworks are checked in. You can install Carthage to update them, but it's not required.

### Contributing
1. Fork the repo
2. Implement your bug fix or feature in a feature branch on your repo
3. Create a Pull Request into einsteinx2/iSub
